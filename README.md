App idea:
I want to make a personalized scheduling app. It can be purposed for day-to-day scheduling, fitness, work, or even a simple calendar. It can behave like the notes app where you can have seperate schedules for whatever purpose. You can have a fitness folder which will contain workouts to follow and nutrition tracking. You can have a folder for a general schedule that the user wants to follow every day. You can obviously add and delete schedules. I also want the app to be vibrant, like instagram, so I will shoot to add some colors to the UI. However, I don't want to overwhelm the user, so I will keep it simple like Spotify.
